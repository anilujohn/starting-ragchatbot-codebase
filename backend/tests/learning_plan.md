- Write effective unit, integration, and system tests
- Debug issues using systematic testing approaches
- Apply test-driven development (TDD) principles

---

## üìÖ **Phase 1: Testing Fundamentals (Week 1)**

### **Day 1-2: Core Concepts**
**Topics to Learn:**
- What is software testing and why it matters
- Types of tests: Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance
- Test structure: Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Test naming conventions

**Hands-on Practice:**
```python
# Start with simple function testing
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add_positive_numbers():
    # Arrange
    a, b = 2, 3
    # Act  
    result = add(a, b)
    # Assert
    assert result == 5

def test_add_negative_numbers():
    result = add(-1, -2)
    assert result == -3

def test_add_zero():
    result = add(5, 0)
    assert result == 5
```

**Resources:**
- Read: Python Testing 101 (Real Python)
- Practice: Write tests for 3 simple functions you've written before

### **Day 3-4: Python unittest Framework**
**Topics to Learn:**
- unittest.TestCase class structure
- setUp() and tearDown() methods
- Different assertion methods (assertEqual, assertTrue, assertRaises)
- Test discovery and running

**Hands-on Practice:**
```python
import unittest

class TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """Run before each test"""
        self.calc = Calculator()
    
    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.add(2, 3), 5)
    
    def test_division_by_zero(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError):
            self.calc.divide(10, 0)
```

**Exercise:** Convert your Day 1-2 functions to unittest format

### **Day 5-7: Edge Cases and Error Handling**
**Topics to Learn:**
- Testing boundary conditions
- Testing error scenarios  
- Input validation testing
- Exception testing patterns

**Hands-on Practice:**
Test a function that validates email addresses:
```python
def test_email_validation():
    # Valid cases
    assert is_valid_email("user@domain.com") == True
    
    # Invalid cases - edge cases matter!
    assert is_valid_email("") == False
    assert is_valid_email("invalid") == False
    assert is_valid_email("@domain.com") == False
    assert is_valid_email("user@") == False
```

---

## üìÖ **Phase 2: Mocking & Isolation (Week 2)**

### **Day 8-10: Understanding Dependencies**
**Topics to Learn:**
- What are dependencies and why they complicate testing
- Test doubles: Mocks, Stubs, Fakes, Spies
- When to mock vs when to use real objects
- The unittest.mock library

**Conceptual Example:**
```python
# Hard to test - depends on external API
def get_weather(city):
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.weather.com/{city}")
    return response.json()["temperature"]

# Easy to test - dependency injected
def get_weather(city, api_client):
    response = api_client.get(f"/{city}")  
    return response.json()["temperature"]

# Test with mock
def test_get_weather():
    mock_client = Mock()
    mock_client.get.return_value.json.return_value = {"temperature": 75}
    
    temp = get_weather("NYC", mock_client)
    
    assert temp == 75
    mock_client.get.assert_called_once_with("/NYC")
```

### **Day 11-12: Mock Strategies**
**Topics to Learn:**
- @patch decorator usage
- Mock return values and side effects
- Asserting mock calls
- Mock best practices

**Hands-on Practice:**
Study our RAG tests and understand the mocking patterns:
```python
# From our tests - mock external dependencies
@patch('rag_system.AIGenerator')
@patch('rag_system.VectorStore') 
def test_rag_system_initialization(self, mock_vector_store, mock_ai_gen):
    rag_system = RAGSystem(self.test_config)
    # Verify dependencies were called correctly
    mock_vector_store.assert_called_once_with(...)
```

### **Day 13-14: Advanced Mocking**
**Topics to Learn:**
- Mocking class instances vs class methods
- Context managers and decorators
- Mock side effects for error simulation
- Partial mocking (mock some methods, keep others real)

**Exercise:** Create a class that reads from a file and writes to a database. Write tests that mock both file I/O and database operations.

---

## üìÖ **Phase 3: Integration & System Testing (Week 3)**

### **Day 15-17: Integration Testing Concepts**
**Topics to Learn:**
- Testing component interactions
- Configuration in tests
- Test data management
- Database testing patterns

**Study Our Integration Tests:**
Analyze `test_rag_integration.py` to understand:
- How we test component interaction
- Why we mock some things but not others
- How configuration affects testing

### **Day 18-19: End-to-End Testing**
**Topics to Learn:**
- Testing complete user workflows
- Test environment setup
- Data cleanup strategies
- Testing with real external services

**Practice Project:**

1. Unit test individual functions
2. Integration test API endpoints
3. System test complete workflows

### **Day 20-21: Configuration & Environment Testing**
**Topics to Learn:**
- Testing different configurations
- Environment variable testing
- Testing deployment readiness

**Topics to Learn:**
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Writing tests before implementation
- TDD benefits and challenges
- TDD for bug fixes

**TDD Exercise:**
Implement a simple shopping cart using TDD:
1. Write failing test for "add item"
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor
4. Repeat for "remove item", "calculate total", etc.

### **Day 25-26: Test Coverage & Quality**
**Topics to Learn:**
- Code coverage tools (coverage.py)
- Coverage vs quality trade-offs
- Test maintenance strategies
- Refactoring tests

**Practice:**
```bash

## üèÜ **Success Indicators**

**You'll know you've mastered application testing when:**
1. You naturally think "how will I test this?" when writing new code
2. You can quickly diagnose issues using systematic testing approaches
3. You write tests that serve as documentation for future developers
4. You can confidently refactor code because tests catch regressions
5. You find bugs in development rather than production

**The ultimate goal:** Transform from "fixing bugs after they happen" to "preventing bugs before they occur" through comprehensive, thoughtful testing strategies.

Remember: **Good tests are like insurance - you're glad you have them when something goes wrong!**
